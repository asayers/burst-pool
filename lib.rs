/*! A thread pool optimised for bursts of activity.

A single thread produces work which is then performed by a pool of worker threads. We expect the
work to be produces infrequently, but in bursts. This means that, in normal operation, all threads
in the pool sleep for some period of time, until some event requires some or all of them to be
suddenly be woken at once. The threads then perform some work before all going back to sleep again.

Normally thread pools schedule work based on thread readiness, and are implemented using a
work-stealing queue. However, this doesn't work well for our use case, since many threads become
runnable at the same time and subsequently create a lot of contention when reading from the queue.
Instead, we use a round-robin scheduling strategy to send work to specific threads, which
eliminates contention at the cost of performing badly in the case where the workloads are uneven
and utilisation is high.

```
use burst_pool::BurstPool;

let mut pool = BurstPool::new();
for tid in 0..3 {
    pool.spawn(move|iter| {
        println!("Thread {} received {}", tid, iter);
    });
}

for i in 0..5 {
    pool.send(i);
}
```

Gives

```none
Thread 0 received 0
Thread 0 received 3
Thread 1 received 1
Thread 1 received 4
Thread 2 received 2
```

## Performance

A pool of 10 threads, to which 10 messages are sent. The threads all wake, read the clock, and then
go back to sleep. On my machine (which has `max_cstate = 0` - this makes a huge difference to
thread wake-up times), I see the following results:

```none
 time (us): frequency
----------:-----------
       0-1:     0
       1-2:     3
       2-2:    57 ++
       2-3:   304 ++++++++++++++
       3-5:   808 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
       5-8:  1289 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
      8-11:  1491 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     11-17:   831 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     17-26:   184 ++++++++
     26-38:    23 +
     38-58:     7
     58-86:     2
    86-130:     1
      130+:     0
