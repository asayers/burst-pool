/*!
This crate provides an SPMC channel for cases where values must be processed now or never, and
workers are woken up all-at-once.

The intended use-case for this library is pretty specific:

* Most of the time things are quiet, but occasionally you have a lot of work to do
* This work must be dispatched to worker threads for processing
* You have more worker threads than can realistically spin-wait
* When you receive work to do, you typically have more work than worker threads

If the above does not apply to you, then the trade-offs made by this library probably aren't good
ones. If it does, however, then using it is fairly straightforward:

```
# use burst_pool::*;
#
# fn sleep_ms(x: u64) {
#     std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(x));
# }
#
// Create a handle for sending strings
let mut sender: Sender<String> = Sender::new();

// Create a handle for receiving strings, and pass it off to a worker thread.
// Repeat this step as necessary.
let mut receiver: Receiver<String> = sender.receiver();
let th = std::thread::spawn(move ||
    loop {
        let x = receiver.recv().unwrap();
        println!("{}", x);
    }
);

// Give the worker thread some time to spawn
sleep_ms(10);

// Send a string to the worker and unblock it
sender.send(Box::new(String::from("hello")));
sender.unblock();

// Wait for it to process the first string and send another
sleep_ms(10);
sender.send(Box::new(String::from("world!")));
sender.unblock();

// Drop the send handle, signalling the worker to shutdown
sleep_ms(10);
std::mem::drop(sender);
th.join().unwrap_err();  // RecError::Orphaned
```

(The name "burst-pool" is a bit of a historical accident. I guess "burst-chan" would be a better
name.)
