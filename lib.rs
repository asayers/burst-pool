/*!
An SPMC channel with low, consistent latency, designed for cases where values arrive in a batch and
must be processed now-or-never.

burst-pool differs from a regular spmc channel in one major way: **sending fails when all workers
are currently busy**.  This lets the sender distribute as much work as possible, and then handle
overflow work differently (probably by throwing it away).

<!--
The intended use-case for this library is pretty specific:

* Most of the time things are quiet, but occasionally you get a lot of work to do.
* This work must be dispatched to worker threads for processing.
* Latency is important, but you have too many worker threads to spin-wait them all.
* When you receive work to do, you typically saturate the pool of workers.

If the above does not apply to you, then the trade-offs made by this library may not be good ones.
-->

## Performance

**tl;dr:** Same ballpark as [spmc]. Best when the number of workers is less than number of cores.

I'm using the excellent [spmc] crate as a benchmark.  spmc provides a reliable unbounded channel,
and when the pool is overloaded it has the normal "queueing" semantics (as opposed to burst-pool's
"return-to-sender" semantics).  The metric we care about is `enqueue`→`recv` latency.  Below are
some kernel density estimates.  The "n/m" notation in the labels means "n messages sent to m
workers".

[spmc]: https://docs.rs/spmc

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asayers/burst-pool/master/benches.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" />

Here's my interpretation of the numbers:

* Keeping the number of workers fixed to 3 and varying the number of messages sent appears to have
  no effect on burst-pool's performance. spmc, on the other hand, compares favourably when pool
  utilisation is low (1/3), becoming gradually worse as the number of messages increases (2/3),
  until it is roughly the same as burst-pool in the saturating case (3/3).
* When the pool is overloaded (4/3, 5/3) we see the difference in the semantics of the two crates.
  In the burst-pool benchmark, only 3 messages are sent and 2 are discarded. In the spmc benchmark,
  all 5 messages are sent, giving a bimodal distribution with the second peak around 1000 μs. (This
  seems to mess up gnuplot.)
* Comparing the two saturating benchmarks (3/3, 6/6) we see another difference. When the number of
  workers is less than the number of available cores (3/3) we see that performance is roughly the
  same, but that burst-pool degrades more badly when it exceeds the number of cores (6/6).
* The response time is generally a bit more reliable for burst-pool than spmc (ie. the variance is
  lower), with the exception of the 1/3 benchmark.

These observations are consistent with the expected performance characteristics. (See
[Design](#design), below.)

Run `cargo bench` to make some measurements on your own machine; there's also a gnuplot script
which you can use to visualise the results.  (Pro tip: If your results are significantly worse than
those above, your kernel might be powering down CPU cores too eagerly.  If you care about latency
more than battery life, consider setting max_cstate = 0.)

## Usage

The API requires two calls to actually send a message to a receiver: first you place your message
in the mailbox of one of your workers (`enqueue`); then you wake the worker up, notifying it that
it should check its mailbox (`wake_all`).  A call to `enqueue` will only succeed if the sender can
find an empty mailbox to put the message in (ie., at least one of your workers must currently be
blocking on a call to `recv`).  If `enqueue` fails, you get your message back.  If it succeeds, the
message will be recieved by exactly one receiver the next time you call `wake_all`.

```
# use burst_pool::*;
#
# fn sleep_ms(x: u64) {
#     std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(x));
# }
#
// Create a handle for sending strings
let mut sender: Sender<String> = Sender::new();

// Create a handle for receiving strings, and pass it off to a worker thread.
// Repeat this step as necessary.
let mut receiver: Receiver<String> = sender.mk_receiver();
let th = std::thread::spawn(move ||
    loop {
        let x = receiver.recv().unwrap();
        println!("{}", x);
    }
);

// Give the worker thread some time to spawn
sleep_ms(10);

// Send a string to the worker and unblock it
sender.enqueue(Box::new(String::from("hello")));
sender.wake_all();
sleep_ms(10);       // wait for it to process the first string

// Send another string
sender.enqueue(Box::new(String::from("world!")));
sender.wake_all();
sleep_ms(10);

// Drop the send handle, signalling the worker to shutdown
std::mem::drop(sender);
th.join().unwrap_err();  // RecvError::Orphaned
```

## Design

Each receiver has a "slot" which is either empty, blocked, or contains a pointer to some work.
Whenever a receiver's slot is empty, it goes to sleep by polling an eventfd.  When issuing work,
the sender goes through the slots round-robin, placing work in the empty ones.  It then signals the
eventfd, waking up all sleeping receivers.  If a receiver wakes up and finds work in its slot, it
takes the work and blocks its slot.  If a receivers wakes up and finds its slot is still empty, it
goes back to sleep.  When a receiver has finished processing the work, it unblocks its slot.

This design means that we expect `enqueue`→`recv` latencies to be independent of the number of
payloads sent.  However, we expect it to become much worse as soon as there are more worker threads
than cores available.  The benchmark results are consistent with these expectations.

## Portability

This crate is Linux-only.
